# passwordvalidator

This project is made simple for beginners to set a web page for password validation using a front end (HTML,CSS,JavaScript)

It doesn't contain any API or Framework

I used a set of English words around 3000 to 5000, to make sure the password doesn't contain any Dictionary English words.
